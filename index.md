# CDC Worked Examples Index

**Caution** These worked examples are definitely **NOT** an alternative to the IBM product docementation.

* The [IBM product documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/idr/11.4.0?topic=change-data-capture-cdc-replication) is the comprehensive source of information for what the product is, and how it can be used.
* These worked examples have been written by an IBM practitioner who has supported many customers in deploying IBM InfoSphere CDC, to provide a narrative that reflects the project-centric implementation at a typical IBM customer.
